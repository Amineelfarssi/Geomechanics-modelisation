 The  method  applies  for  ruptures  confined to  a  plane  separating  homogeneous  elastic  half  spaces.  In  this  method,  the  physical  variables,  such  as  the traction  components  of  stress  and  displacement  discontinuity  on  the  rupture  plane,  are  represented  as Fourier  series  in  space  with  time-dependent  coefficients.  An  analytical  solution  is  found  for  each  Fourier mode,  in  that  each  Fourier  coefficient  for  stress  is  expressed  by  the  time  convolution  of  the  corresponding coefficient  for  displacement  with  a  convolution  kernel  specific  to  the  rupture  mode.  So,  in order  to  study  the  evolution  of  a  single  rupture,  one  has  to  use  a  spatial  period  large  enough  in  order  that the  waves  coming  from  the  replication  cracks  do  not  enter  the  zone  of  interest  during  the  time  duration studied,  or  provide  negligible  stress  alteration  when  they  do  arrive. The 2D  modelisation ( using the resolution of eq (1)  in matlab) of the discontinuity generated in the case of mode 1 crack propagation  , gave us a a space-time profile of the discontinuity along the crack although , the profile showed some ripples , in the edges . This ripples correspond to an overshooting of some discontinuity present in spatial-discontinuity function , This phenomenon is called Gibbs phenomenon . To avoid the Gibbs  phenomenon we can abolish the discontinuity from the function  entirely, nevertheless it is possible to ameliorate the overshoot and oscillations by use of Lanczos's a factors, or FÃ©jer Kernels . The application of those methods led to the elimination of the overshooting although the final spatiotemporal discontinuity function was not as realistic as we estimated.
